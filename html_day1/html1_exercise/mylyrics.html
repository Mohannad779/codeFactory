      <h1>Lyrics My Enemy</h1>
      <div>
        <span> wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows</span>
        <span>For my mind to run
        around with my ear up to the ground</span>  I'm searching to behold the stories
        that are told When my back is to the world that was smiling when I
        turned
      </div>
      <div>Tell you you're the greatest But once you turn, they hate us</div>
      <div>
        Oh, the misery Everybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy
        Everybody wants to be my enemy (Look out for yourself) My enemy (look,
        look, look, look) (Look out for yourself) But I'm ready
      </div>
      <div>
        Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall And the laughter
        in the halls and the names that I've been called I stack it in my mind
        and I'm waiting for the time When I show you what it's like to be words
        spit in a mic
      </div>
      <div>
        Tell you you're the greatest But once you turn, they hate us (huh)
      </div>
      <div>
       <span>Oh, the misery Everybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy
        Everybody wants to be My enemy (look, look, look, look) (Look out for
        yourself)</span> My enemy (look, look, look, look) (yeah) (Look out for
        yourself)
      </div>
      <div>
       <span> Uh, look Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me I'm praying that</span>
        somebody hope for me I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be P-P-Posted,
        being a wreck of emotions Ready to go whenever, just let me know The
        road is long, so put the pedal into the floor The enemy on my trail, my
        energy unavailable I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego" They wanna plot on my
        trot to the top I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an
        astronaut I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe And it
        matters more because I had it not Had I thought about wreaking havoc on
        an opposition Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm
        automatic Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking Pack it, pack it up, I
        don't panic Batter, batter up, who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause
        we at your throat
      </div>
      <div>
        Everybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy Everybody wants to be
        My enemy
      </div>
      <div>
        Oh, the misery Everybody wants to be my enemy Spare the sympathy
        Everybody wants to be my enemy
      </div>
      <div>
        it away, I swear I'll never be a saint, no way My enemy Pray it away, I
        swear I'll never be a saint
      </div>
